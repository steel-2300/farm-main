# Hodl Farm (Yield Farm)
## Overview
This repository implements a Dai staking mechanism; whereby, the user is rewarded with HodlTokens (HODL) for staking their Dai. The staking rewards give the user 1% of their Dai balance in HodlToken every 60 seconds (approximately). Obviously, this type of yield is not realistic for a quality token; however, this project aimed to explore a viable automated staking strategy encoded in solidity.
